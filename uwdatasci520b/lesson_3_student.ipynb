Make sure to review it again because it will help with this assignment too. In this assignment, we learn about another such example. At first blush, the answer may seem obvious, but your job is to show the right answer using the rules of probability we learned in the lecture.\n",

The difference of course is that you can have two or more daughters born on a Thursday, but you can only name one of your daughters Leila. So this subtle distinction should play out in your solution.
